	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">A task vector specifies a direction in the weight space of a pre-trained model</mark>, such that <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">movement in that direction improves performance on the task</mark>.
	- We <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a task</mark>.
	- We show that these <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">task vectors can be modified and combined together through arithmetic operations</mark> such as negation and addition, and the behavior of the resulting model is steered accordingly.
	- Negating a task vector decreases performance on the target task, with little change in model behavior on [control tasks]([definition - When referring to Neural Networks, what is a "control task" or "controller design"? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8632539/when-referring-to-neural-networks-what-is-a-control-task-or-controller-desig)).
	- Moreover, adding task vectors together can improve performance on multiple tasks at once.
